# The main point about these actions, is they are not Iotic,
# but they all need to be easily slotted into any of the action points in
# iotic callbacks, or any action points in iotic data generating code.

# Note: This is not a definitive list of canned actions

# Could write all action handlers to a particular interface
# format, and then you could just pass them as a parameter to a feed or control instance
# and it pre-knits handler code that makes it all happen.

# CANNED ACTIONS

#B   rate
#B   aggregate
#B   average

#B   buzzer
#B   visualise (how?)
#B   store in file
#B   store in database
#B   scaled graph
#B   display single value
#B   display metadata for single value
#B   play speech

#TODO: CANNED SENDERS

#Canned senders might just be pre-rolled objects that you pass as a parameter
#to a feed or a control, and it sorts all the wiring out for you.

#?   when new data appears in file, send it
#?   when new data appears in a database, send it
#?   when this GPIO pin changes, send bool
#?   when this new data comes in from a UART, send it
#?   others
